ArrayList

The ArrayList class extends AbstractList and implements the List interface. ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.
Standard Java arrays are of a fixed length. After arrays are created, they cannot grow or shrink, which means that you must know in advance how many elements an array will hold.
Array lists are created with an initial size. When this size is exceeded, the collection is automatically enlarged. When objects are removed, the array may be shrunk.
Initializing
The ArrayList class supports three constructors. The first constructor builds an empty array list.:
The following constructor builds an array list that is initialized with the elements of the collection c.
The following constructor builds an array list that has the specified initial capacity. The capacity is the size of the underlying array that is used to store the elements.
The capacity grows automatically as elements are added to an array list.
