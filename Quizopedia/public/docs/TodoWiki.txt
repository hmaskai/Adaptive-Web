Suggestions
New Layout
I'm going to have a crack at suggesting a possible outline for the book.
Steady Progression
This book is more of a reference than a learning book. It needs to be easier for newbies starting out how to program. Then have dedicated more advance topics later.--Mattylaws (discuss • contribs) 12:37, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
