Javadoc

Java allows users to document the classes and the members by using a particular syntax of comment.
Syntax
A documentation comment is framed by slash-star-star and star-slash (i.e. /** ... */). The documentation is in the HTML format.
A documentation comment is placed just above the commented entity (class, constructor, method, field).
In a documentation comment, the first part is a description text in the HTML format. The second part is a list of special attributes whose name starts with an at sign (@):
Here is a non exhaustive list of special attributes:
If the entity flagged as deprecated by this attribute is used, the compiler give a warning.
See also annotations since Java 5.
Documentation
The JDK provides a tool named javadoc which allows to generate the documentation of the well commented classes. The javadoc command without argument give the complete syntax of the command.
Example : for a class named Example defined in a package named org.wikibooks.en dans le fichier C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\Example.java :
The documentation can be generated in a specific folder (C:\ProgDoc for example) with the following command:
The options of this command are described below:
The description page of a package copy the description text from the file named package.html which should be placed in the given folder. In our example, we should document the package in the file C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\package.html.
Since Java 5[1], the package.html file can be replaced by a special Java file named package-info.java containing only the package declaration preceding by a documentation comment.
