Client Server

In 1990s, the trend was moving away from Mainframe computing to Client/Server, as the price of Unix servers dropped. The database access and some business logic were centralized on the back-end server, collecting data from the user program was installed on the front-end users' "client" computers. In the Java world there are three main ways the front-end and the back-end could simply communicate.

Create a Server
Java language was developed having network computing in mind. For this reason it is very easy to create a server program. A server is a piece of code that runs all the time listening on a particular port on the computer for incoming request. When a request arrives, it starts a new thread to service the request. See the following example:
Listening on a port
Service One Client
Handling the request; implements the communication protocol
The Data object that goes through the network
Create the Client
A client code for a server/service is usually an API that a user application uses to interface to the server. With the help of a client API the user application does not have to know how to connect to the server to get services.
The following is the client class for the above server:
