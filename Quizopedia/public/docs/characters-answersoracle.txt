Question: In the following program, called ComputeResult, what is the value of result after each numbered line executes?
CODE:
public class ComputeResult {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "software";
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("hi");
        int index = original.indexOf('a');

/*1*/   result.setCharAt(0, original.charAt(0));
/*2*/   result.setCharAt(1, original.charAt(original.length()-1));
/*3*/   result.insert(1, original.charAt(4));
/*4*/   result.append(original.substring(1,4));
/*5*/   result.insert(3, (original.substring(index, index+2) + " ")); 

        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

Exercise: Write a program that computes your initials from your full name and displays them.
Answer: ComputeInitials
CODE:
public class ComputeInitials {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String myName = "Fred F. Flintstone";
        StringBuffer myInitials = new StringBuffer();
        int length = myName.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(myName.charAt(i))) {
                myInitials.append(myName.charAt(i));
            }
        }
        System.out.println("My initials are: " + myInitials);
    }
}
Exercise: An anagram is a word or a phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase; for example, "parliament" is an anagram of "partial men," and "software" is an anagram of "swear oft." Write a program that figures out whether one string is an anagram of another string. The program should ignore white space and punctuation.
Answer: Anagram
CODE:
public class Anagram {

    public static boolean areAnagrams(String string1,
                                      String string2) {

        String workingCopy1 = removeJunk(string1);
        String workingCopy2 = removeJunk(string2);

	    workingCopy1 = workingCopy1.toLowerCase();
	    workingCopy2 = workingCopy2.toLowerCase();

	    workingCopy1 = sort(workingCopy1);
	    workingCopy2 = sort(workingCopy2);

        return workingCopy1.equals(workingCopy2);
    }

    protected static String removeJunk(String string) {
        int i, len = string.length();
        StringBuilder dest = new StringBuilder(len);
  		char c;

	    for (i = (len - 1); i >= 0; i--) {
	        c = string.charAt(i);
	        if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
		        dest.append(c);
	        }
	    }

        return dest.toString();
    }

    protected static String sort(String string) {
	    char[] charArray = string.toCharArray();

	    java.util.Arrays.sort(charArray);

        return new String(charArray);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String string1 = "Cosmo and Laine:";
        String string2 = "Maid, clean soon!";

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Testing whether the following "
                         + "strings are anagrams:");
        System.out.println("    String 1: " + string1);
        System.out.println("    String 2: " + string2);
        System.out.println();

        if (areAnagrams(string1, string2)) {
            System.out.println("They ARE anagrams!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("They are NOT anagrams!");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
