Summary
A program can use exceptions to indicate that an error occurred. To throw an exception, use the throw statement and provide it with an exception object ? a descendant of Throwable ? to provide information about the specific error that occurred. A method that throws an uncaught, checked exception must include a throws clause in its declaration.
A program can catch exceptions by using a combination of the try, catch, and finally blocks.
The try statement should contain at least one catch block or a finally block and may have multiple catch blocks.
The class of the exception object indicates the type of exception thrown. The exception object can contain further information about the error, including an error message. With exception chaining, an exception can point to the exception that caused it, which can in turn point to the exception that caused it, and so on.
