Answers to Questions and Exercises: Enum Types
Answer: False. All enums implicitly extend java.lang.Enum. Because a class can only extend one parent, the Java language does not support multiple inheritance of state, and therefore an enum cannot extend anything else.
Exercise: Rewrite the class Card from the exercise in Questions and Exercises: Classes so that it represents the rank and suit of a card with enum types.
Answer: See Card3.java, Suit.java, and Rank.java.
Exercise: Rewrite the Deck class.
Answer: See Deck3.java.
