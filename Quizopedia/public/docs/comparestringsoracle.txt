Comparing Strings and Portions of Strings
The String class has a number of methods for comparing strings and portions of strings. The following table lists these methods.
Region is of length len and begins at the index toffset for this string and ooffset for the other string.
Region is of length len and begins at the index toffset for this string and ooffset for the other string.
The boolean argument indicates whether case should be ignored; if true, case is ignored when comparing characters.
The following program, RegionMatchesDemo, uses the regionMatches method to search for a string within another string:
CODE:
public class RegionMatchesDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String searchMe = "Green Eggs and Ham";
        String findMe = "Eggs";
        int searchMeLength = searchMe.length();
        int findMeLength = findMe.length();
        boolean foundIt = false;
        for (int i = 0; 
             i <= (searchMeLength - findMeLength);
             i++) {
           if (searchMe.regionMatches(i, findMe, 0, findMeLength)) {
              foundIt = true;
              System.out.println(searchMe.substring(i, i + findMeLength));
              break;
           }
        }
        if (!foundIt)
            System.out.println("No match found.");
    }
}
The output from this program is Eggs.
The program steps through the string referred to by searchMe one character at a time. For each character, the program calls the regionMatches method to determine whether the substring beginning with the current character matches the string the program is looking for.
