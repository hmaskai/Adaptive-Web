Answers to Questions and Exercises: Numbers
Use the API documentation to find the answers to the following questions:
Question: What Integer method can you use to convert an int into a string that expresses the number in hexadecimal? For example, what method converts the integer 65 into the string "41"?
Answer: toHexString
Question:What Integer method would you use to convert a string expressed in base 5 into the equivalent int? For example, how would you convert the string "230" into the integer value 65? Show the code you would use to accomplish this task.
Answer: valueOf. Here's how:
CODE:
String base5String = "230";
int result = Integer.valueOf(base5String, 5);
Question: What Double method can you use to detect whether a floating-point number has the special value Not a Number (NaN)?
Answer: isNaN
Question: What is the value of the following expression, and why?
CODE:
Integer.valueOf(1).equals(Long.valueOf(1))
Answer: False. The two objects (the Integer and the Long) have different types.
Exercise: Change MaxVariablesDemo to show minimum values instead of maximum values. You can delete all code related to the variables aChar and aBoolean. What is the output?
Answer: See MinVariablesDemo. Here is the output:
CODE:
The smallest byte value is -128
The smallest short value is -32768
The smallest integer value is -2147483648
The smallest long value is -9223372036854775808
The smallest float value is 1.4E-45
The smallest double value is 4.9E-324
Exercise: Create a program that reads an unspecified number of integer arguments from the command line and adds them together. For example, suppose that you enter the following:
CODE:
java Adder 1 3 2 10
The program should display 16 and then exit. The program should display an error message if the user enters only one argument. You can base your program on ValueOfDemo.
Answer: See Adder.
Exercise: Create a program that is similar to the previous one but has the following differences:
For example, suppose that you enter the following:
CODE:
java FPAdder 1 1e2 3.0 4.754
The program would display 108.75. Depending on your locale, the decimal point might be a comma (,) instead of a period (.).
Answer: See FPAdder.
